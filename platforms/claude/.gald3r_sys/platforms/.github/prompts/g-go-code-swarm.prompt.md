Alias for `@g-go-code --swarm`: $ARGUMENTS

Runs **implementation only** in swarm mode — partitions the work queue into conflict-safe
buckets and spawns N parallel agents. Every completed item is marked `[🔍]`.

This is exactly `@g-go-code --swarm`. Use this command for discoverability.
Implementation-only boundary: this command must not spawn reviewer agents, run `g-go-review` / `g-go-review-swarm`, or invoke `gald3r-code-reviewer` / full adversarial review subagents. It may run only implementation readiness checks: import/build/typecheck/lint, focused tests, acceptance-criteria self-check, workspace/constraint/stub/bug-discovery gates, and checkpoint/handoff creation.
If swarm eligibility leaves exactly one runnable item after workspace preflight, auto-downgrade to standard `@g-go-code` mode and continue without asking. If workspace preflight fails because the target repo is not registered, is not a git root, or is not authorized for the task/bug routing metadata, stop with that blocker instead of offering fallback.
The coordinator must create or reuse one T170 coding worktree per bucket before spawning
implementation agents, then reconcile bucket outputs back into the primary checkout one at a time.
The coordinator must skip non-expired `[📝]` speccing claims before partitioning and log stale speccing-claim takeovers before worktree allocation.
Bucket agents return patch bundles, generated artifacts, test evidence, changed-file inventories, and proposed status rows. They must not write shared `.gald3r` indexes/status files, `CHANGELOG.md`, generated Copilot prompts, parity outputs, final staging, or commits. The coordinator performs one final shared-write pass and never accepts broad `git add .` output from a bucket.
After the coordinator reconciles buckets and performs final shared writes, it creates a code-complete checkpoint commit and emits a review handoff. Review swarms later use that checkpoint as their default branch-addressable source; dirty snapshot review is fallback-only.

Throughput rule: do not stop the coding queue merely because a task moved to `[🔍]`. After each checkpoint commit, recompute the runnable queue and start the next coding wave when dependencies are implementation-satisfied by `[🔍]` checkpointed work. Only pause for dependencies that explicitly declare `requires_verified_dependencies: true`, PCAC conflicts, Workspace-Control preflight blockers, or unresolved reconciliation failures. Review runs later in a separate command or in `g-go --swarm`; do not launch it from `g-go-code-swarm`.


### PCAC Inbox Gate (Only When PCAC Is Configured)

Before task claiming, implementation, verification, planning, or swarm partitioning, first determine whether this project is a PCAC participant. PCAC is configured only when `.gald3r/linking/link_topology.md` declares at least one parent/child/sibling relationship, or `.gald3r/PROJECT.md` explicitly declares PCAC project linking relationships. A Workspace-Control manifest and local `INBOX.md` alone do not make the project a PCAC group member.

If PCAC is configured, run the re-callable PCAC inbox check when the hook exists.

> **Tool routing (BUG-031)**: on Windows, invoke this snippet through the **PowerShell tool**, not Bash. It uses PowerShell-only syntax (`@(...)` array, `Where-Object`, `Test-Path`, `Select-Object`, pipeline). Routing it through Bash produces a parse error such as ``syntax error near unexpected token `('`` — that failure is a tool-selection error, **NOT** a real PCAC conflict gate. Re-run via PowerShell. On Linux/macOS hosts use `pwsh` if available; if neither shell can reach the hook, treat the gate as advisory and let Workspace-Control routing re-evaluate.

```powershell
$hook = @( ".cursor\hooks\g-hk-pcac-inbox-check.ps1", ".claude\hooks\g-hk-pcac-inbox-check.ps1", ".agent\hooks\g-hk-pcac-inbox-check.ps1", ".codex\hooks\g-hk-pcac-inbox-check.ps1", ".opencode\hooks\g-hk-pcac-inbox-check.ps1" ) | Where-Object { Test-Path $_ } | Select-Object -First 1
if ($hook) { powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $hook -ProjectRoot . -BlockOnConflict }
```

Installed templates may call the equivalent hook from the active IDE folder. If the check reports `INBOX CONFLICT GATE` or exits with code `2`, stop immediately and run `@g-pcac-read`; do not claim tasks, create worktrees, spawn reviewers, or continue planning until conflicts are resolved. Non-conflict requests, broadcasts, and syncs are advisory and should be surfaced in the session summary.


### Gald3r Housekeeping Commit Gate (T531)

<!-- T531-HOUSEKEEPING-GATE -->
After the PCAC gate is skipped or passes and **before** the Clean Controller Gate hard-blocks the run, run the safety classifier helper at the orchestration root:

```powershell
.\scripts\gald3r_housekeeping_commit.ps1 -Mode preflight -Apply -TaskId <id-when-known> -Json
```

Behavior:

- **`clean`** -> continue.
- **`safe-gald3r-housekeeping`** -> the helper stages **only** allowlisted controller `.gald3r/` paths via explicit `git add -- <paths>` (never `git add .`), re-checks for drift, and creates a focused `chore(gald3r): preflight gald3r housekeeping` commit. The run continues automatically.
- **`unsafe-gald3r` / `mixed-dirty` / `conflict` / `drift-detected` / unknown `.gald3r` paths / member-repo `config-fault`** -> the helper exits non-zero, the existing Clean Controller Gate hard-block applies, and the run STOPs with the exact unsafe paths listed.

The helper allowlist covers the safe controller `.gald3r/` coordination surfaces (TASKS.md, BUGS.md, FEATURES.md, PRDS.md, SUBSYSTEMS.md, IDEA_BOARD.md, learned-facts.md, tasks/, bugs/, features/, prds/, subsystems/, reports/, logs/pcac_auto_actions.log, linking/sent_orders/, linking/INBOX.md). The deny list covers `.identity`, `.user_id`, `.project_id`, `.vault_location`, `vault/`, `config/`, `.gald3r-worktree.json`, secret-named files, and unknown `.gald3r/` paths. Member-repo targets (marker-only `.gald3r/`) are refused -- this gate is **controller-only**.

Re-run the helper in `-Mode post-write -Apply` immediately after coordinator-owned shared `.gald3r` writes (task/bug status writes, review-result writes, sent_orders ledger updates, safe report/log outputs) and before the next major phase so the shared-state dirty window stays short. In `--swarm` flows only the coordinator runs the helper; bucket agents remain handoff producers.
### Clean Controller Gate (before claims, worktrees, reconciliation)

After the PCAC gate is skipped or passes:

1. At the **orchestration git root** (the repo from which you run this command — normally the Workspace-Control owner, e.g. `gald3r_dev`): run `git status --short`. If anything is listed **outside** this run's explicit coordinator staging allowlist for the active task and bug IDs, **STOP** here. Do not claim tasks or bugs, create or reuse T170 worktrees, partition swarms, or write coordinator-owned updates to `.gald3r/TASKS.md`, `.gald3r/BUGS.md`, other shared `.gald3r` coordination files, `CHANGELOG.md`, generated Copilot prompts, or parity output until unrelated changes are committed, stashed, or moved to a prior focused commit. Preserve any bucket handoff artifacts already produced and list the paths that blocked progress.

2. **`gald3r_worktree.ps1 -AllowDirty`**: do not use this switch for `g-go`, `g-go-code`, `g-go-review`, or any `--swarm` variant **except** when every dirty path is owned exclusively by the active task/bug scope and a `## Status History` row documents that override. Otherwise clean the checkout first. The same **per-root** `-AllowDirty` discipline applies to every repository included in the touch set below when multi-repo work is in scope.

3. **Member touch-set (v1 — `workspace_repos`)** — The orchestration root is **always** gated. When the active task or bug declares **`workspace_repos:`** with manifest `repository.id` entries, extend the gate to each **other** resolved member root (blast radius follows declared cross-repo scope). Read `.gald3r/linking/workspace_manifest.yaml` when present; map each listed ID (deduplicated) to `repositories[?].local_path`. For each existing path, run `git -C "<path>" rev-parse --show-toplevel` then `git status --short` at that root. Apply the same **explicit coordinator staging allowlist** per root. Skip IDs whose paths are missing while `lifecycle_status` is a planned/bootstrap gap (report only; do not expand the touch set). If the manifest is missing while `workspace_repos` is non-empty, or an ID is unknown under `repositories:`, **STOP** multi-repo coordinator work until manifest or frontmatter is repaired (controller-only queue items whose `workspace_repos` lists only the owner id may proceed once that id resolves).

4. **Touch-set expansion (v2 — optional signals)** — Union extra repository roots into the same per-root checks (still **not** a blanket scan of every manifest member):
   - **`extended_touch_repos:`** — optional task/bug YAML list of additional manifest `repository.id` values beyond `workspace_repos`.
   - **`touch_repos:` (swarm handoffs)** — In `--swarm` runs, when bucket work edits roots not already covered by `workspace_repos` + `extended_touch_repos:`, bucket summaries and the coordinator reconciliation block MUST list those ids under `touch_repos:` so the union is gated before shared writes.
   - **Subsystem `locations:` absolutes** — When the active item declares **`subsystems:`**, read each `.gald3r/subsystems/{name}.md` frontmatter **`locations:`** (all nested strings). For values matching a host **absolute** path (`^[A-Za-z]:[/\\]` on Windows, or POSIX `/` rooted at `/` elsewhere), if the path exists, resolve `git -C <dir> rev-parse --show-toplevel` (use the file's parent directory when the path is a file). Each distinct root **other than** the orchestration root joins the touch set. Relative paths do not expand the set.

### Pre-Reconciliation Clean Gate (before coordinator shared writes)

Also re-run the **Gald3r Housekeeping Commit Gate** with `-Mode post-write -Apply` against the orchestration root immediately after each coordinator-owned shared `.gald3r` write so safe controller coordination state lands in a focused `chore(gald3r): commit g-go coordination state` commit before the next major phase begins.


Immediately before the coordinator merges bucket results into the primary checkout, updates shared `.gald3r` indexes or task/bug files as coordinator-owned writes, touches `CHANGELOG.md`, or creates checkpoint / review-result commits: **re-run** `git status --short` on the **orchestration root and every other repository root in the computed touch set** (steps 1 + 3 + 4). For `--swarm` runs, if unrelated dirty paths appear in **any** of those roots during parallel bucket work, **fail closed** — do not apply those shared writes; keep patches, artifacts, and evidence; report **per-root** blockers using the same blocker family as checkpoint and review-result commits.

### PCAC Inbox Heartbeats (Swarm / Long Runs)

For swarm mode or any run lasting more than 30 minutes, the coordinator reruns the PCAC inbox check every 30 minutes and once more before the final summary. If a conflict appears mid-run, pause new claims/spawns/reconciliation, preserve worktrees and partial outputs, and require `@g-pcac-read` before continuing.
